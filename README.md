 How It Works
The extension listens for predefined keyboard shortcuts such as:
Ctrl + Shift + 1 → Red
Ctrl + Shift + 2 → Blue
Ctrl + Shift + 3 → Green
... up to Ctrl + Shift + 0

When a shortcut is pressed, the extension injects a small script into the active tab and changes the background color.
The extension also includes a popup with buttons for users who prefer clicking.
