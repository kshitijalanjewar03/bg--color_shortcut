Background Color Shortcuts – Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows users to change any webpage’s background color instantly using keyboard shortcuts or a pop-up menu.
It is specially designed to help visually impaired users by giving them quick access to comfortable background colors.

 Features

✔ Change webpage background color using keyboard shortcuts
✔ 10 different color options
✔ Easy pop-up UI for manual color selection
✔ Lightweight and fast
✔ Runs on any website
✔ Helpful for users with low vision, light sensitivity, dyslexia, and visual strain

 How It Works
The extension listens for predefined keyboard shortcuts such as:
Ctrl + Shift + 1 → Red
Ctrl + Shift + 2 → Blue
Ctrl + Shift + 3 → Green
... up to Ctrl + Shift + 0

When a shortcut is pressed, the extension injects a small script into the active tab and changes the background color.
The extension also includes a popup with buttons for users who prefer clicking.
